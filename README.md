# StutterCut: Uncertainty-Guided Normalised Cut for Dysfluency Segmentation

**StutterCut** is a semi-supervised graph-based framework for segmenting speech dysfluencies without requiring strong labels or transcriptions. It partitions speech embeddings using a soft-constrained clustering method based on Normalised Cut (N-Cut), enhanced by uncertainty-aware classifier guidance.

This repository will host:
- The source code for StutterCut
- Scripts for training and evaluation
- The FluencyBank++ dataset with frame-level dysfluency annotations

> ðŸ“¢ **Coming Soon**  
> The code and dataset will be made publicly available shortly. Please stay tuned!
