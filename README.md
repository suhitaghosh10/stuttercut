# StutterCut: Uncertainty-Guided Normalised Cut for Dysfluency Segmentation

**StutterCut** is a semi-supervised graph-based framework for segmenting speech dysfluencies without requiring strong labels or transcriptions. It partitions speech embeddings using a soft-constrained clustering method based on Normalised Cut (N-Cut), enhanced by uncertainty-aware classifier guidance.
